# Sparse Lattice Network (SplatNet) for Point Cloud Processing

This implementation was done as course project for [Intelligent Visual Computing](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/courses/visual_computing/index.html) at UMass! 

Implemented hierarchical and spatially-aware feature learning neural architecture for semantic labeling of unordered and unprocessed 3D point cloud.  
Implemented Trilinear interpolation for feature mapping in Euclidean lattice. 
Dataset used: [PartNet v0](https://www.shapenet.org/)
